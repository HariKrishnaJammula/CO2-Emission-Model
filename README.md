In our Project we aim to use the machine learning techniques to predict the CO2 emissions values for the next 15 years (2024- 2038). Our approach is based on the below goals
we want to accomplish in our research:
  1. Expanding our research beyond the United States or G20 countries and exploring global countries for Carbon dioxide (co2) emission patterns.
  2. Data extracted from the past two decades (1998 â€“ 2022) to ensure the latest trends in global emissions particularly emissions related to CO2 are taken into consideration.
  3. Implementing machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the future CO2 values for the next 15 years up to 2038.
